    <h3>electric scooter</h3>
    <p>E-scooters are a potentially environmentally friendly alternative personal mode of transportation that has appeal
        in urban settings and for short distances. However, they are not exempt from the vulnerabilities users may
        encounter in road traffic injuries similar to the exposures pedestrians and bicyclists when sharing the
        roads.[6]

        In Europe, before 2024, the majority of crashes did not involve another vehicle, while 80% of e-scooter rider
        deaths and 50% of trauma patients’ injuries resulted from crashes involving a heavier motor vehicle.[5]

        In France, between 2019 and 2022, a 185% increase in e-scooter riders was admitted to trauma centres.[5]</p>

    <p>An e-scooter or electric kick scooter is an electric motorized scooter – a stand-up scooter powered by an
        electric hub motor in its front and/or rear wheel. It is generally designed with a large center deck on which
        the rider stands.

        They are classified as a form of micromobility; e-scooters are included in scooter-sharing systems that use apps
        to allow users to rent them by the minute. Such systems are now present in major and mid-sized cities all over
        the world.</p>

    <p>Motorized kick scooters are used in law enforcement, security patrolling[9][10] and leisure. New ride-sharing
        systems have made e-scooters easily accessible. They are popular in urban areas and are used as an alternative
        to bicycling or walking.[11] Ride sharing companies first started dropping these scooters off in large US cities
        in 2018, and the need for short distance easy access transportation in many cities has meant that they have
        become increasingly popular with more and more companies looking to join the market.[12]</p>

    <p>E-scooters usually have two wheels between 8 and 11 inches (20–28 cm) in diameter, connected by a platform on
        which the rider stands, with a handlebar for support and steering.[1]</p>
